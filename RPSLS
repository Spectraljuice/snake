@description:Create a game which should allow the player to compete against the 
computer in a game of "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock".  Once the game is 
working, build a basic AI for the computer so it begins to 'learn' about the 
player and their habits.  The game should output win statistics to a text file 
continuously to verify AI success.
