Description: Create an application which will continuously ask for grades 
(0-100) for assignments.  Once the user inputs a 'q', the program should output 
the average of all of the input grades.

'''
#Defines the Grades as a list and sets a hard limit
grades = []
limit = 10000
#A while true loop to take user input and add it to the grades list.
while True:
   #if the grades inputed is more than the limit, break the loop
    if len(grades)>limit:
        break
    #Takes input and makes it 
    grade = input("Input grade (0-100) or q to quit:")
    
    if grade.lower()=="q":
        break
    try: 
        grade = float(grade)
        if grade<0 or grade>100:
            raise Exception("Not a Valid number")
        else:
            grades.append(grade)
        
    except:
        print("Thats not a number between 0-100")
sum = 0
if len(grades)>0:
    for grade in grades:
        sum+=grade
    print(sum/len(grades))
